# Recipes Online

Recipes online is a member and non-member friendly website in which users can search for recipes 
which other users have shared. 

Every user will have the option to register or not, when registered a profile will be created. 
This profile will show all the recipes the user has uploaded as well as showing recipes they have 
favourited for later use.

## **Members can:**

* Search the recipes using the search bar. 

# UX 
This website is for novice to advanced bakers/cooks, who want a community to share recipes and try new 
recipes. 
My website will help them achieve this as they are able to make a profile if they want to, and have a profile
page where the recipes they have added are stored, and where they can favourite recipes for later use.

# Technologies Used
Within the website, I have used many external resources to help construct the webiste and 
increased the user experience. 
### Jquery 
A widely known external library to 'write less, do more'. It simplifies the code needed when
using Javascript. https://jquery.com/

This is an external library of icons which have been used around the site to make it more
visually appealing.

# Testing 

### Python code checker
Throughout the project, I used https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html to check the python code 
and syntax was all correct, and made any changes accordingly. 

### Search bar 
To test the search bar function, I used a word I knew was in the recipes list and made sure it showed up.
I then used a word I knew wasn't in the recipes list and made sure the 'no recipes found' messsage
appeared. 

### Register function 
To test the register function:
* Go to the register page to make sure it connects correctly.
* Enter a username without a password to make sure an error occurs and that an account is not 
made.
* Enter a username that I knew was already in use to make sure that an error occurs which says; "username
already in use"
* Enter a valid username and password, which should successfully make a profile.
* If a profile has been made more options on the nav bar should appear. I.e 'add recipe',
'view favourites', 'profile'. 

### Log In function
To test the log in function:
* Go to log in page to make sure it connects properly. 
* Enter and incorrect username and/or password to make sure an error occurs which says; "incorrecr 
username and/or password"
* Enter correct username and password, which should successfully log user in. 
* If user has been logged in more options on the nav bar should appear. I.e 'add recipe',
'view favourites', 'profile'.
